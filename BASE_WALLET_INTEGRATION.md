## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies Added
```json
{
  "@coinbase/wallet-sdk": "^4.x.x",
  "wagmi": "^2.x.x",
  "viem": "^2.x.x"
}
```

### Key Components

#### 1. Web3 Configuration (`src/lib/web3.ts`)
- Configures Wagmi with Base networks
- Sets up Coinbase Wallet connector with Smart Wallet preference
- Defines transport layers for blockchain communication

#### 2. Web3 Provider (`src/components/Web3Provider.tsx`)
- Wraps the application with Wagmi provider
- Integrates with existing React Query setup

#### 3. Base Wallet Connect (`src/components/BaseWalletConnect.tsx`)
- Handles wallet connection/disconnection
- Displays connection status and wallet address
- Provides user-friendly connection interface

#### 4. Web3 Transaction (`src/components/Web3Transaction.tsx`)
- Interface for sending ETH transactions
- Transaction status tracking
- Error handling and user feedback

#### 5. Wallet Auth Hook (`src/hooks/use-wallet-auth.ts`)
- Manages wallet authentication state
- Provides connection status and user address
- Handles wallet disconnection

### Network Configuration

The integration supports both Base networks:
- **Base Mainnet** (Chain ID: 8453)
- **Base Sepolia Testnet** (Chain ID: 84532)

### Authentication Flow

1. **Web3-Only Flow**: Users connect their Base Wallet to access all features
2. **Automatic Redirect**: Successful wallet connection redirects to the shop
3. **Persistent Session**: Wallet connection state is maintained across sessions

### Security Considerations

- Smart Wallet preference ensures users get the best Base Wallet experience
- Proper error handling for failed transactions
